# The Archive
The archive is a collection of components that were once part of either the testing or the the actual project, but were later abandoned.
For more information on why a specific component was abandoned, please refer to the README.md file in the corresponding directory.

## Please note
> Things placed in the archive are not necessarily bad or broken. They were just not the right fit for this project as far as I could tell.
> I might change my mind in the future and bring some of these components back to life. Who knows?
