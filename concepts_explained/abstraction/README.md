# (Layers of) Abstraction
The following is a brief overview of what layers of abstraction are, why they are important and how they were implemented in this project  

## A short introduction
Abstraction can be seen as a way to hide the complexity of a system by only showing the necessary details.  
Let's take a website as an example. It consists of a frontend (what the user sees) and a backend (what the user doesn't see).  

## Why is abstraction important?
Layers of abstraction are important because they make the code more reusable and maintainable.  
In the case of this project, multiple layers of abstraction were added to make it easier for the team to "do many things without having to do many things".  

## How is abstraction implemented in this project?
In this project, layers of abstraction are used to make the code more reusable and maintainable.  
The way abstraction layers implemented is by first writing something (i.e. some code) and then replacing parts of that something (the code) with variables or functions. (making that piece of code reusable)
