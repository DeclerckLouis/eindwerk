# Inventory plugins (for Ansible)
## What are inventory plugins?
Inventory plugins are used to dynamically generate an inventory for Ansible.
This means that instead of using a predefined static inventory file, the inventory is generated at runtime.
this means, for example, that you can use the NetBox API to generate an inventory of all your devices.
